## DESCRIPTION

Solr Chef Cookbook; allowing you to install Solr easily in /data on a (solo|util) instance.

## NOTICE

As much as possible, avoid forking this cookbook. If you want to customize the way you setup Solr, please modify `custom-solr`. That way your recipes do not diverge considerably from the mainstream Engine Yard recipes. We will do our best to make all customizations possible just by modifying `custom-solr`.

## USAGE

Please see the usage [notes](../custom-solr/README.md#usage) for the [custom-solr recipe](../custom-solr/).
