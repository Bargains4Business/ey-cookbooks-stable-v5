Establishes the cookbooks that run during different types of chef functions. The "Main" run is used when "Apply" is selected on the dashboard, as the first run of any new instance, or on reboot. The "Integrate" (or "quick") run is used only when a new instance is added to an environment to update the dna and configuration files of the other instances in the environment.
